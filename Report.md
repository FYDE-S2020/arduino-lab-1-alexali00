## Questions

1. Why does your program need a setup and a loop?

    Setup: To enable certain pins and set them to input or output
    Loop: Continuously run the program that was coded

2. What is the downside to putting all your code in a loop?

    It is redundant to continuously initialize pins and it is less organized

3. Why does your code need to be compiled?

    So a file is created in machine language that the computer can read

4. When lowering the frequency in procedure A, step 4, what is going wrong? Brainstorm some solutions. Dimmers exist in the real world. What is their solution?

   It flickers as it brightens and dims
   Solutions: use a constant frequency

5. Why do you need to connect the logic analyzer ground to the ESP32 ground?

    So the voltages are relative to the same ground value

6. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous communication?
